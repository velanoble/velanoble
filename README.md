I'm Vela. An artist and hobbyist coder. 

I have an interest in game dev, web dev, all sorta cool things.

Yes I get it, my art is better than my code, but I love to try new things. Stop gatekeeping people from trying new things. 
 
If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.

My smaller games are also [on my site](https://velanoble.com/) but most are on Itch.io instead.
