I'm Vela, an artist, writer and super hobbyist coder. Interested in games, apps, web whatever cool things idk I'm justa dumb artist?

Yes I get it, my art is better than my code, but I love to try new things. Stop gatekeeping people from trying new things. 
 
If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.

My smaller games are also [on my site](https://velanoble.com/) but most are on Itch.io instead.
