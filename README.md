- I'm Vela, an artist, writer and hobbyist game dev.
- I love Ren'Py and Gamemaker Studio2!
- Probably not doing this right, github is just where I backup all my projects lol.
- [Itch.io (or my site) is where I post my games.](https://velanoble.itch.io/)
- If you wanna work together, contact me through my site!
