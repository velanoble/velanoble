I'm Vela. An artist, writer and hobbyist coder.

I made my own webcomic site from scratch at <a href="https://lostmybootsoutwandering.com/">Lost My Boots Out Wandering</a>!

I also have developed my own main artsy portfolio website at <a href="https://velanoble.com">velanoble.com</a>.

Everything I have learnt about web stuff started with my techy dad who helped me figure out how to launch my first site, but due to my own relentless curosity for learning things for myself, I improved in my own time.

If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.
