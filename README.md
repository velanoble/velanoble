I'm Vela. An artist and  hobbyist coder. 

I enjoy goofing around in web and game dev, but the longest 'project' I've had is my artsy portfolio website <a href="https://velanoble.com">velanoble.com</a> which is an ever changing project, and I like it that way. 

I'm also trying to learn new things in order to make an app idea that is very close to my heart. 

If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.
