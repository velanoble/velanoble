I'm Vela, an artist, writer and hobbyist game dev.

Yes I get it. My art is better than my code, I love to try new things.

I like to do the [global game jam](https://globalgamejam.org/users/vela-noble) every year. It's just a ritual.
I post most my games [on my site, not just Itch.io.](https://velanoble.com/) 
 
 Stop gatekeeping people from making video games. Everyone belongs making games.
 
 But idk I just see bad art and bad storytelling everywhere I look.
 
 If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.
