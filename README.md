I'm Vela. An artist and  hobbyist coder. 

I enjoy goofing around in web and game dev, but the longest 'project' I've had is my artsy portfolio website <a href="https://velanoble.com">velanoble.com</a> which is an ever changing project, and I like it that way. It has my webcomics on it.

If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.
