I'm Vela, a comic maker and hobbyist coder.

I made my own fantasy/adventure/memoir webcomic site from scratch at <a href="https://lostmybootsoutwandering.com/">Lost My Boots Out Wandering</a>. 
I update it with new chapters on the 1st Tuesday of the month around 8pm (ACST).

I also have developed my own main artsy portfolio website at <a href="https://velanoble.com">velanoble.com</a>.

Everything I have learnt about web stuff started with my techy dad who helped me figure out how to launch my first site, but due to my own relentless curosity for learning things for myself, I improved in my own time.

Honestly, I had failed with gamedev a lot before realising how webdev suits my artistic practice a lot more.

If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.
