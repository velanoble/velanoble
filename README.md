I'm Vela, an artist, writer and hobbyist game dev.

Yes I get it. My art is better than my code, but I've enjoyed trying to learn new things.
I am a storyteller so am mostly into making and playing narrative-heavy games, anyways.
 [I try to post my games on my site, not just Itch.io.](https://velanoble.com/) 
 
 You can't gatekeep people from gamedev or trying a skill they aren't a master at. 
 Everyone belongs making games.
 
 If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.
