I'm Vela, an artist, writer and (super hobbyist) game dev when I feel like it.

I love both Ren'Py and GameMaker Studio. I got into those around 2021. 
My history with game dev is it was my first job ever to be hired as a concept artist. 
But more than that job, I cherish doing jams and honing my own stories, worlds and character's way more.

Yes I get it. My art is better than my code!
I just enjoy trying to learning new things.
I am a storyteller by nature so am mostly into making and playing narrative-heavy games anyways.
 [I try to post my games on my site, not just Itch.io.](https://velanoble.com/) 
 
 You can't gatekeep people from gamedev or trying a skill they aren't a master at. 
 
 Everyone belongs making games.
 
 If you wanna work together, contact me through my site.
