I'm Vela, an artist, writer and hobbyist programmer. A mum living in Adelaide, Australia. I love both Ren'Py and GameMaker Studio. 

Everyone seems to know my art is better than my code, lol!
 [Itch.io or my site is where I post my games.](https://velanoble.itch.io/)
 
 If you wanna work together, contact me through my site!
