I'm Vela, an artist, writer and hobbyist game dev.

Yes I get it. My art is better than my code, I love to try new things.
 [I try to post my games on my site, not just Itch.io.](https://velanoble.com/) 
 
 Stop gatekeeping people from gamedev. Everyone belongs making games.
 
 If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.
