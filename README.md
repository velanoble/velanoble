I'm Vela, an artist, writer and hobbyist programmer. Also a proud mum living in Adelaide, Australia.

I love both Ren'Py and GameMaker Studio. I got into those around 2021. 
My history with game dev is it was my first job ever to be hired as a concept artist. 
But more than that job, I cherish being able to participate in the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/users/vela-noble">GGJ most years since 2016</a>.

Yes I get it, my art is better than my code. I felt fed up with barriers of managing teams for my fun projects, so I tried learning how to code by myself. 

I am a storyteller by nature so am mostly into making and playing narrative-heavy games anyways, regardless of what engine I can use.

 [Itch.io or my site is where I post my games.](https://velanoble.itch.io/) 
 
 You can't gatekeep people from gamedev or trying a skill they aren't a master at, everyone belongs making games.
 If you wanna work together, contact me through my site.

I'm trying to organise the GGJ in South Australia for 2026! Check back soon.
