I'm Vela, an artist, writer and hobbyist game dev.

Yes I get it, my art is better than my code, but I love to try new things. Just stop gatekeeping people from making video games. Everyone belongs making games.
 
If you have an inquiry, just contact me through my site.

My smaller games are also [on my site](https://velanoble.com/) but most of my massive visual novels are on Itch.io instead.
